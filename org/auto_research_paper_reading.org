* auto auto generation
  Finding the necessary paper is now becoming more and more a problem. In the deep learning area there is newest information almost every month, even every week. However, most of the paper just describe a new structure or a new dataset, which, as far as I am considered, can be automatically done. Hence, Is that possible to build a system which can read the paper automatically, and reproduce the model described in the paper. Or maybe we can find a unified way to describe the model. Hence, the next thing can be just handled to the deep model it self.
